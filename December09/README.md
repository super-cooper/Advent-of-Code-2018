# Marble Mania 
You talk to the Elves while you wait for your navigation system to initialize. 
To pass the time, they introduce you to their favorite 
[marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_\(toy\)) game.

The Elves play this game by taking turns arranging the marbles in a __circle__ 
according to very particular rules. The marbles are numbered starting with `0` 
and increasing by `1` until every marble has a number.

First, the marble numbered `0` is placed in the circle. At this point, while it 
contains only a single marble, it is still a circle: the marble is both clockwise 
from itself and counter-clockwise from itself. This marble is designated the 
__current marble.__

Then, each Elf takes a turn placing the __lowest-numbered remaining marble__ into 
the circle between the marbles that are `1` and `2` marbles __clockwise__ of the 
current marble. (When the circle is large enough, this means that there is one 
marble between the marble that was just placed and the current marble.) The 
marble that was just placed then becomes the __current marble.__

However, if the marble that is about to be placed has a number which is a multiple 
of `23`, __something entirely different happens.__ First, the current player keeps 
the marble they would have placed, adding it to their __score.__ In addition, the 
marble `7` marbles __counter-clockwise__ from the current marble is __removed__ 
from the circle and __also__ added to the current player's score. The marble 
located immediately __clockwise__ of the marble that was removed becomes the new 
__current marble.__

For example, suppose there are 9 players. After the marble with value __0__ is 
placed in the middle, each player (shown in square brackets) takes a turn. The 
result of each of those turns would produce circles of marbles like this, where 
clockwise is to the right and the resulting current marble is in parentheses:

The goal is to be the __player with the highest score__ after the last marble is 
used up. Assuming the example above ends after the marble numbered `25`, the 
winning score is `23+9 =`**`32`** (because player 5 kept marble `23` and removed 
marble `9`, while no other player got any points in this very short example game).

Here are a few more examples:

 - `10` players; last marble is worth `1618` points: high score is __`8317`__
 - `13` players; last marble is worth `7999` points: high score is __`146373`__
 - `17` players; last marble is worth `1104` points: high score is __`2764`__
 - `21` players; last marble is worth `6111` points: high score is __`54718`__
 - `30` players; last marble is worth `5807` points: high score is __`37305`__

__What is the winning Elf's score?__

Your puzzle answer was `386018`.

## Part Two 

Amused by the speed of your answer, the Elves are curious:

__What would the new winning Elf's score be if the number of the last marble were 
100 times larger?__

Your puzzle answer was `3085518618`.
