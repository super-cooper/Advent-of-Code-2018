# Settlers of The North Pole

On the outskirts of the North Pole base construction project, many Elves are collecting lumber.

The lumber collection area is 50 acres by 50 acres; each acre can be either __open ground__ (`.`), 
__trees__ (`|`), or a __lumberyard__ (`#`). You take a scan of the area (your puzzle input).

Strange magic is at work here: each minute, the landscape looks entirely different. In exactly 
__one minute,__ an open acre can fill with trees, a wooded acre can be converted to a lumberyard, 
or a lumberyard can be cleared to open ground (the lumber having been sent to other projects).

The change to each acre is based entirely on __the contents of that acre__ as well as __the number 
of open, wooded, or lumberyard acres adjacent to it__ at the start of each minute. Here, "adjacent" 
means any of the eight acres surrounding that acre. (Acres on the edges of the lumber collection 
area might have fewer than eight adjacent acres; the missing acres aren't counted.)

In particular:

 - An __open__ acre will become filled with __trees__ if __three or more__ adjacent acres contained 
 trees. Otherwise, nothing happens.
 - An acre filled with __trees__ will become a __lumberyard__ if __three or more__ adjacent acres 
 were lumberyards. Otherwise, nothing happens.
 - An acre containing a __lumberyard__ will remain a __lumberyard__ if it was adjacent to __at 
 least one other lumberyard and at least one acre containing trees.__ Otherwise, it becomes 
 __open.__

These changes happen across all acres __simultaneously,__ each of them using the state of all acres 
at the beginning of the minute and changing to their new form by the end of that same minute. 
Changes that happen during the minute don't affect each other.

For example, suppose the lumber collection area is instead only 10 by 10 acres with this initial 
configuration:

After 10 minutes, there are `37` wooded acres and `31` lumberyards. Multiplying the number of 
wooded acres by the number of lumberyards gives the total __resource value__ after ten minutes: 
`37 * 31 =`**`1147`**.

__What will the total resource value of the lumber collection area be after 10 minutes?__

Your puzzle answer was `564375`.

## Part Two 

This important natural resource will need to last for at least thousands of years. Are the Elves 
collecting this lumber sustainably?

__What will the total resource value of the lumber collection area be after 1000000000 minutes?__

Your puzzle answer was `189720`.
